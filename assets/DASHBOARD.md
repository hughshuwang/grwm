TODOs, Thursday Jul 16

- Got some delay as the previous license expired and they then issued a temporary one-month license to fill the gap
- Inflated tax term and updates to penalty functions for customized preference, on progress
- Now I don't see any infeasible warning in the test cases covered in the last version of package shared
- Robustness review, have the option to change parameters for the precaution, still have many hard constraints which might conflict and yield infeasible solution, as least making finding a feasible solution very slow. 
- Automate scenario exploration: generate alternative scenarios, rely more on outside data pipelines than the solver and backtester.
